======== 10/4

== Proposal Game
- Create statistics for the proposal_game
- Grab a intuitive scenario from the proposal_game, present to dparkes
    - Create intuitive scenario for non common knowledge case (non common observation)

== Avalon
- Answer more person-based vs. team-based questions like:
    - Do strong players try to "hide" more? (pass missions more often?)
- Come up with ideas for models that captures intuition/thinking


======== 9/26
=== Analyzing the real data
- Compute an ELO measure
    - As an individual difference measure
    - helps with a question is "how often does a good guy pass?" "how about is that as a function of skill?"

- On the game itself:
    - High level agents can't ever be fooled???
        - Run the simulation many times, average payoff
    - Different K levels
    - Different bad guy starting positions
    - More players

- Simulation stuff
    - Use pandas, seaborn for plotting (+ matplotlib)
