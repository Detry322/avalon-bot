=== Analyzing the real data
- Compute an ELO measure
    - As an individual difference measure
    - helps with a question is "how often does a good guy pass?" "how about is that as a function of skill?"

- On the game itself:
    - High level agents can't ever be fooled???
        - Run the simulation many times, average payoff
    - Different K levels
    - Different bad guy starting positions
    - More players

- Simulation stuff
    - Use pandas, seaborn for plotting (+ matplotlib)
